# 3 Sum: Given an array of numbers and a target value, return the *all* the triplets of indices of the three numbers which 0:
# Random order 
# No duplicates

# initial thoughts, we need to keep track of the values seen and their indices alreay
# not 100% sure how two pointers comes in to play
# need to store sums? 
# build a structure of two sums doublets and then see if there are "target - value" in the two_set_structure/checker
