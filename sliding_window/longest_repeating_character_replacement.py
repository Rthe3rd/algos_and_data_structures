# You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

# Output: 4
# Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

# Output: 4
# Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
# The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
# There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.
