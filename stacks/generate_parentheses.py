# 22. Generate Parentheses
# Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

# If open count is greater than closed count, you can add either
# If open count is equal to closed count, you can only add an open
# If the open/close count is less than 3, you can add an open/close
